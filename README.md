# Electric-Current-Monitoring-System
Electric current measure system for different kind of light bulbs based on an ATmega16. The main goal is to return a feedback in order to evaluate different light bulbs and determine the most efficient one given the relation between consumption and brightness. This project greatly contributes to an efficient, economic and green bulb choice. Everything is reported within an interface acceded by bluetooth which contains data about current consumption and real time feedback.

## General requirements
* Computer with Microchip studio and processing
* Basic knowledge of ATmega16's hardware
* Basic understanding of embedded C AVR microcontrollers
* Basic electronics knowledge
* Access to the following materials:
  * ATmega16
  * AVR ATmega16 mimimum system
  * USB ISP USBasp Programmer
  * 4 different light bulbs to evaluate
  * 4 - ACS712 (Electric current sensors)
  * 4 - Photoresistors
  * 4 - Relays (Could be 4 relay module)
  * HC-06 bluetooth module
  * OLED display with SSD1306 driver
  * 2 - Push buttons
  * 2 - 330 ohm resistors
